ArmCord is a custom client designed to enhance your Discord experience while keeping everything lightweight.
Features:
 - Standalone client
ArmCord is built as a standalone client and doesn't rely on the original Discord client in any way.
 - Various mods built-in
Enjoy Vencord, Shelter and their many features, or have a more vanilla experience, it's your choice!
 - Themes
ArmCord natively supports theming of the entire app, you can easily import BetterDiscord themes and manage them
 - Made for Privacyâ„¢
ArmCord automatically blocks all of Discord's trackers; even without any client mods, you can feel safe and secure!
 - Supports Rich Presence
Unlike other clients, ArmCord supports rich presence (game activity) out of the box thanks to arRPC.
 - Mobile support
ArmCord has experimental mobile support for phones running Linux such as the PinePhone. While this is still far from an ideal solution, we're slowly trying to improve it.
 - Much more stable
ArmCord is using a newer build of Electron than the stock Discord app. This means you can have a much more stable and secure experience, along with slightly better performance.
 - Cross-platform support!
    ArmCord was originally created for ARM64 Linux devices since Discord doesn't support them. We soon decided to support every platform that Electron supports!

You can use markdown to format your text and make it more readable. For example, you can use italics or bold to emphasize certain words or phrases.
