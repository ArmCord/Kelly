Latest Version: 3.2.3
ArmCord is a custom client designed to enhance your Discord experience while keeping everything lightweight. ArmCord is a desktop app.
Features:
 - Standalone client
ArmCord is built as a standalone client and doesn't rely on the original Discord client in any way.
 - Various mods built-in
Enjoy Vencord, Shelter and their many features, or have a more vanilla experience, it's your choice!
 - Themes
ArmCord natively supports theming of the entire app, you can easily import BetterDiscord themes and manage them
 - Made for Privacyâ„¢
ArmCord automatically blocks all of Discord's trackers; even without any client mods, you can feel safe and secure!
 - Supports Rich Presence
Unlike other clients, ArmCord supports rich presence (game activity) out of the box thanks to arRPC.
 - Mobile support
ArmCord has experimental mobile support for phones running Linux such as the PinePhone. While this is still far from an ideal solution, we're slowly trying to improve it.
 - Much more stable
ArmCord is using a newer build of Electron than the stock Discord app. This means you can have a much more stable and secure experience, along with slightly better performance.
 - Cross-platform support!
ArmCord was originally created for ARM64 Linux devices since Discord doesn't support them. We soon decided to support every platform that Electron supports!

How does this work?   
ArmCord is using the official web app and wrapping it up in Electron. You can very easily load themes and mods with no installers/injectors. You can even make the client have transparency effects and follow the fluent design of Windows! At its core, it's just a simple web wrapper, however, we applied many patches to make this work well for you <3

Will I get banned for using this?   
You are breaking [Discord ToS](https://discord.com/terms#software-in-discord%E2%80%99s-services) by using ArmCord, but no one has been banned from using it or any of the client mods included.

You can use markdown to format your text and make it more readable. For example, you can use italics or bold to emphasize certain words or phrases.

Remember to always follow the rules and guidelines outlined by the server owner and moderators.

If anybody asks you for support of any sorts, tell them to go to the support channel which is: "<#1142418048607854714>".

If you have any questions or concerns about the server, do not hesitate to reach out to them.

And finally, don't forget to have fun! Discord is a great place to meet new people, make new friends, and enjoy some quality conversation.
